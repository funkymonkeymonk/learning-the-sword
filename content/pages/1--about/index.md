##Welcome

My name is Will Weaver, known in the [SCA](https://www.sca.org) as [Lord Erich Guter Muth](https://wiki.eastkingdom.org/index.php?title=Erich_Guter_Muth). I've created this as a place for me to document and share my study into historical arms. My hope to do it in such a way that allows it to not only serve as a memory aid for me, but as a tool to be used for guiding my training. As such the information applied here may often be incorrect or inconsistent. It represents my knowledge at the moment of writing. I will endeavor to go back and create new articles which correct previous ones and link in my previous ones to them, but that may not always happen.
