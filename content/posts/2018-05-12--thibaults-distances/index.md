One of the things that drew me to Thibault's system was how each action is derived through it's geometric relationships to each component of the fencer and the duel. There is nothing that Thibault says that is not backed up but a relationship, which he carefully builds by observable relationship from the diameter, or the total length of a person from the soles of their feet to the height of the arm outstretched with elbow next to the top of the head. This leads to a system of fighting where each distance is relative only to one variable, the height of the fencer.

As I dug into the _Academy of the Sword_ I couldn't help myself from having my mind wander to how these relationships plotted into formula's. Since height is the basis of the circle and each intersection is one step, then a formula for the stride of someone at a given height should be attainable. Thankfully Doroga of [Black Birds and Blades](https://blackbirdsandblades.blogspot.com/) pointed me to an amazing article in the [Acta Periodica Duellatorum](https://www.actaperiodicaduellatorum.com/) called Thibault and Science I. Measure, Distances and Proportions in the Circle by J치nos Maj치r, PhD and Zolt치n V치rhelyi. The original text is available [here](https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/apd/2/1/article-p67.xml?rskey=oEJnbK&result=1)

One of the things I found most amazing was the accuracy that could be acquired from these proportions. In the paper the remark that Thibault divides the diameter into 10 parts which they refer to as a Thibault unit (ThU).

> In the case of a person, who is 196.9cm tall (from sole to the top of the head), 1 ThU is equal to 10cm. Henceforth 1 minute is equal to 1mm. If the fencer is 175cm tall, 1 ThU=8.89cm, and 1 minute is equal to 0.889mm.

This to me was astounding. Building a system of measure that could be accurate to less than the width of my pinky nail, but as easy to understand as the analogy of "less than the width of my pinky nail" is incredible. More so was the common unit they proposed of the Thibault Number or ThU. Being able to convert these geometric proportions into algebra which is more easily understood given my modern western mathematics upbringing was really helpful. As such I built a [calculator](/measurements) which uses any height to build out the relative distances that they mention in the paper. This is opening up even more questions which I'm hoping to answer in future posts. For right now I want to get back to coding and research and see how far I can take these calculations.
